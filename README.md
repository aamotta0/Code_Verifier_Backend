MERN Stack with RESTful API
Introduction
This project is a boilerplate for creating a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application with a RESTful API. It integrates various technologies such as TypeScript, Nodemon, Jest, Swagger, and Mongoose.

Technologies Used
MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing application data.
Express.js: Node.js web application framework used for building robust APIs.
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
Nodemon: Utility that monitors changes in your code and automatically restarts the server.
Jest: JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing.
Swagger: Open-source software framework used for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services.
Mongoose: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
